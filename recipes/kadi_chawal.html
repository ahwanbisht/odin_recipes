    <h2>Steps (Instructions)</h2>
    <h3>Making Curd Slurry</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl take the sour curd and whisk it well till smooth</li>
        <li>Add gram flour, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder and salt to the whisked curd.</li>
        <li>Stir and mix everything again.</li>
        <li>Add 3 cups water and stir again.</li>
        <li>Stir very well to make a smooth mixture without lumps. If there are lumps, then break them with a wired whisk or a spatula or with your fingers. Set the curd slurry aside.</li>
        <li>You can use a blender to make this mixture, but make sure you don’t over do it. You will get butter instead of a smooth blended curd.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Making Pakora for Kadhi</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the gram flour in a bowl and add carom seeds, red chili powder, garam masala powder and salt.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup thinly sliced onions.</li>
        <li>Mix everything well and set aside covered for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>This will allow the onions to release their water in the mixture. Depending on the water content in the onions, the mixture will become very moist or just about moist.</li>
        <li>Then accordingly add water as required to make a thick batter. I added ¼ cup water.</li>
        <li>Heat oil for deep frying in a pan or kadai. Let the oil become medium hot. Then with a spoon carefully drop the pakora batter in the oil.</li>
        <li>When the pakora are partly cooked, then turn over and fry the other side.</li>
        <li>Fry till the pakora are crisp and golden.</li>
        <li>Remove the fried pakora and place them on a kitchen paper towel so that extra oil is absorbed. Fry the pakora in batches this way. When done set all of them aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Making Kadhi</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In another pan or kadai, heat mustard oil. Make sure to use a large bottomed pot so that while boiling, the kadhi does not spill.</li>
        <li>Add the cumin seeds, fenugreek seeds and asafoetida. Allow the cumin seeds to crackle and the fenugreek seeds to change their color. Fry on a low flame, so that these spices do not get burnt.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onions. Stir and sauté for 3 minutes on a low to medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Then add chopped ginger, chopped garlic and chopped green chillies. Stir and sauté for a minute.</li>
        <li>Now add curry leaves, dry red chilies (halved or broken and seeds removed). Stir and sauté for a minute on a low flame.</li>
        <li>Then add the curd slurry.</li>
        <li>Stir very well.</li>
        <li>Increase the flame to medium and bring the kadhi to a boil. Keep on stirring often so that the bottom does not get browned. Time taken to cook kadhi will be around 14 to 16 minutes.</li>
        <li>After the kadhi has come to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for more 6 to 7 minutes. The kadhi will thicken. </li>
        <li>If the kadhi becomes too thick, then add some hot water.</li>
    </ol>
